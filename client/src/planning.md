# Game Planning

## Progression Outline

This game will focus on the unlocking of skills as you progress. The main driving force of the early game will be combat skills (likely strength, attack, and hp/vitality).

Players can train combat at the **Training** screen. This screen will have a Tap Heroes style system where types of monsters can be attacked for experience (and potentionally drops). As you hit certain kill counts on monsters, more difficult monsters will become available to attack. This screen becomes very difficult and has diminishing returns in the early game. It is only meant to get you just powerful enough to begin challenging the **Dungeon**.

The **Dungeon** will have different levels/floors. As you descend, monster encounters get more difficult, but you can also come across more diverse loot and, ultimately, areas that provide new skill access. An example would be finding a mine which can be repaired using resources gained by defeating enemies in the previous floors. Once repaired, the **Mining** skill and screen becomes available.

The **Mining** screen allows you to mine ore that you have discovered in mines found by exploring the dungeon.

Another screen available from the beginning of the game is the **Inventory** and **Guild** screens. The **Inventory** is self explanatory, but the **Guild** screen is where you can - at first - sell materials. It will also serve as a place to get quests later in the game.

Once you discover the **Mining** skill and gain your first ores, you will be directed to the **Town** screen which will allow you to eventually unlock the **Smithing** skill.

This type of progression will lead to unlocking each skill. Each skill (aside from combat skills) comes with a unique advantage and/or mechanic that will add to and mesh with the other skills and their proficiency. For example, smithing new armor will make fighting easier, but smithing a new iron fishing rod will increase fishing success rate.
